============================

![solarized palette](https://github.com/soulseekah/prestashop-variable-shipping/raw/master/screenshot.png)

Custom shipping price for manual orders in PrestaShop. Adds a new field that overrides shipping costs for orders that are not formed via the front-end carts due to shipping restrictions (weight, cost, address, etc.). Works for PrestaShop 1.7.8 and above.
